- 👋 Hi, I’m @CuccoForCoding
- 👀 I’m interested in writing code to catch fish.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to be a Front-End Dev without a Project Manager. It's going suprisingly well!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that need assistance that are within my skill set. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Please email joeycucco@gmail.com
